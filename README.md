# JAL: Just Another Language

Want to see more about the Untyped Syntax? [Click here](test/untyped.al)

**TODO**:

- [~] Parser
  - [ ] dot-syntax for modules
- [~] Interpreter
  - [ ] side effects/IO module hosted by Haskell

**Think more later:**

- [ ] Support for explicit types
- [ ] Maybe add a IR like [Haskell Core](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-to-core#the-simplicity-of-core)? VM later? hmm
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Type inference

**Disclaimer:** I'm _dumb_, so the codebase have a lot to improve.
